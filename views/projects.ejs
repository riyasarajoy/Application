        <h3>PAWSIBLE</h3>
        <p>
          People who encounter unforeseen situations such as financial or health problems may find themselves unable to care for their pets, leading them to make the difficult decision to give them up for adoption or abandon them near roadsides. Unfortunately, many of these animals end up suffering from injuries as a result. Additionally, pet shelters often struggle to care for large numbers of animals due to financial difficulties or a lack of staff.
          To address these issues, we have developed a software platform that connects pet owners looking to surrender their pets directly with potential adopters.
